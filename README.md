This program classifies images of hand written digits. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model has been used to classify the images. The MNIST hand
written digits dataset was used, and it has been split into an 80/20 train test split. Some data pre processing has been performed including normalisation,
reshaping, and augmentation. The performance of the model can be determined using the cross validation score, classification report, and confusion matrix. 
The program has been set up in a way that allows turning on or off data augmentation by commenting or uncommenting the augmentData() fucntion call within main().
